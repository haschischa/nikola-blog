<h3>PROLOGUE</h3>
<p><span class="smallcaps">The</span>   ma­­na­ger of the new Im­pe­ri­al Re­­stau­rant on the Tha­­mes Em­­bank­­ment wen­t
in­­to his lux­­u­ri­ous pri­va­­te of­­fice and shut the do­or. Ha­­ving do­­ne so, he
­­first scrat­ched his chin re­­f­lecti­ve­ly, and then took a let­­ter from the
drawer in which it had re­po­­sed for mo­­re than two months and pe­ru­­sed it
ca­­re­­ful­ly. Though he was not awa­­re of it, this was the thir­­ti­eth ti­­me he
­­had re­ad it sin­­ce bre­ak­­fast that mor­­ning. And yet he was not a whit
­­ne­a­­rer un­­der­s­­tan­­ding it than he had been at the be­­gin­­ning. He tur­­ned it
o­ver and scru­­ti­­ni­zed the back, whe­­re not a sign of wri­­ting was to be
­­se­en; he held it up to the win­­dow, as if he might ho­pe to di­­sco­ver
so­­met­­hing from the wa­­ter-­­mar­k; but the­­re was not­­hing in eit­­her of the­­se
pla­­ces of a na­­tu­­re cal­cu­la­­ted to set his trou­b­­led mind at rest. Then he
­­took a mag­­ni­­fi­­cent re­pe­a­­ter watch from his waist­coat pock­­et and glan­­ced
at the di­al; the hands stood at hal­­f-­­past seven. He im­­me­­di­a­­te­ly threw
the let­­ter on the ta­­b­le, and as he did so his anx­­i­e­ty found re­­li­ef in­­ words.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>It’s re­al­ly the most ex­­tra­or­­di­­na­ry af­­fair I ever had to do wit­­h,” he
­­re­­marked. “And as I’ve been in the bu­­si­­ness just thre­e-an­d-thir­ty ye­ars
at ele­ven a.m. next Mon­­day mor­­ning, I ought to know so­­met­­hing about it.
I on­ly ho­pe I’ve do­­ne right, that’s all.”</p> 
 <p>As he spo­ke, the chi­ef book­kee­per, who had the tre­ble ad­van­ta­ge of be­ing­
­tall, pret­ty, and just eight-an­d-­twen­ty ye­ars of ag­e, en­te­red the ro­om.
She no­ti­ced the open let­ter and the look upon her chi­e­f’s fa­ce, and her
cu­ri­o­si­ty was pro­por­tio­na­te­ly ex­ci­ted.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>You se­em wor­ri­ed, Mr. McP­­her­­son,” she sa­id ten­­der­ly, as she put down
the pa­pers she had brought in for his ­­sig­­na­­tu­­re.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>You ha­ve just hit it, Miss O’­Sul­­li­van,” he an­swered, pushing them
­­fart­­her on to the ta­­b­le. “I am wor­ri­ed about many thing­­s, but
­­par­­ti­cu­lar­ly about this ­­let­­ter.”</p> 
 <p>He han­ded the epist­le to her, and she, be­ing de­si­rous of im­pres­sing him
with her bu­si­ness ca­pa­bi­li­ti­es, re­ad it with os­ten­ta­tious ca­re. But it
­was no­ti­ce­a­b­le that when she reached the sig­na­tu­re she too tur­ned back­
­to the be­gin­ning, and then de­li­be­ra­te­ly re­ad it over again. The ma­na­ger
ro­se, cros­sed to the man­tel­pie­ce, and rang for the head wai­ter. Ha­ving­
­re­li­e­ved his fee­lings in this way, he se­a­ted him­self again at his
wri­ting­-­tab­le, put on his glas­ses, and sta­red at his com­pa­ni­on, while
­wai­ting for her to speak.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>It’s ve­ry fun­ny,” she sa­id. “Ve­ry fun­ny in­­deed!”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>It’s the most ex­­tra­or­­di­­na­ry com­mu­­ni­ca­­tion I ha­ve ever re­­ce­i­ved,” he
­­re­p­li­ed with con­­vic­­tion. “Y­ou see it is writ­­ten from Cuy­a­­ba, Bra­­zil. The
­­da­­te is three months ago to a day. Now I ha­ve ta­­ken the trou­­b­­le to fin­d
out whe­­re and what Cuy­a­­ba is.”</p> 
 <p>He ma­de this con­fes­sion with an air of cons­cious pri­de, and ha­ving do­ne
so, laid him­self back in his chair, stuck his thumbs in­to the arm­ho­les
of his waist­coat, and looked at his fair sub­or­di­na­te for ap­p­ro­val. Nor
­was he des­ti­ned to be dis­ap­poin­ted. He was a bache­lor in pos­ses­sion of a
snug in­come, and she, be­si­des be­ing pret­ty, was a la­dy with a keen ey­e
­to the main­ chan­ce.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>And whe­­re   <em>is</em>  Cuya­ba?” she asked ­hum­bly.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Cuy­a­­ba,” he re­p­li­ed, rolling his ton­g­ue with con­­si­­de­ra­b­­le re­­lish roun­d
­­his un­cons­­cious mispro­nun­­ci­a­­tion of the na­­me, “is a town al­­most on the
wes­­tern or Bo­­li­­vi­an bor­­der of Bra­­zil. It is of mo­­de­ra­­te si­ze, is
­­si­­tu­a­­ted on the banks of the ri­ver Cuy­a­­ba, and is con­­si­­de­rably con­­nected
with the fa­­mous Bra­­zi­­li­an Di­a­­mon­d ­­Fi­­elds.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>And do­es the wri­­ter of this let­­ter li­ve t­­he­­re?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I can­­not say. He wri­­tes from the­­re—t­­hat is enough for us.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>And he or­­ders din­­ner for four—­­he­­re, in a pri­va­­te ro­om over­loo­king the
ri­ver, three months ahead—­­pun­c­­tu­al­ly at eight o’clock, gi­ves you a list
of the things he wants, and even ar­ran­ges the de­co­ra­­tion of the ta­­b­le.
­­Says he has ne­ver seen eit­­her of his three fri­ends be­­fo­­re; that one of
t­­hem hails from (he­­re she con­­sul­­ted the let­­ter again) Hang­­-chow, anot­­her
­­from Blo­em­­fon­­te­in, while the third re­­si­­des, at pre­­sen­t, in Eng­­land. Each
o­­ne is to pre­­sent an or­­di­­na­ry vi­­si­­ting card with a red dot on it to the
­­por­­ter in the hall, and to be shown to the ro­om at on­­ce. I don’t
un­­der­s­­tand it at all.”</p> 
 <p>The ma­na­ger pa­u­sed for a mo­men­t, and then sa­id de­li­be­ra­te­ly,—”­Hang­-chow
is in Chi­na, Blo­em­fon­te­in is in Sout­h A­f­ri­ca.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>What a won­­der­­ful man you are, to be su­­re, Mr. McP­­her­­son! I ne­ver can
  <em>think</em>  how you ma­na­ge to car­ry so much in your ­head.”</p> 
 <p>The­re spo­ke the true wo­man. And it was a mo­ve in the right di­rection,
­for the ma­na­ger was su­scep­tib­le to her gent­le in­flu­ence, as she had
oc­ca­sion to k­now.</p> 
 <p>At this jun­c­tu­re the head wai­ter ap­peared upon the sce­ne, and took up a
­po­si­tion just in­si­de the do­or­way, as if he were af­raid of in­ju­ring the
car­pet by co­ming­ ­fart­her.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Is No. 22 re­a­­dy, Wil­­li­ams?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Qui­­te re­a­­dy, sir. The wi­­ne is on the ice, and cook tells me he’ll be
­­re­a­­dy to dish pun­c­­tu­al to the ­­mo­­ment.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>The let­­ter says, ‘no electric light; can­d­­les with red sh­a­­des.’ Ha­ve you
­­put on tho­­se sh­a­­des I got this ­­mor­­ning­­?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Just seen it do­­ne this ve­ry mi­nu­­te, ­­sir.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>And let me se­e, the­­re was one ot­­her thing­­.” He took the let­­ter from the
chi­ef boo­k­­ke­e­per’s hand and glan­­ced at it. “A­­h, yes, a por­­celain sau­­cer,
and a small jug of new milk upon the man­­tel­pi­e­­ce. An ex­­tra­or­­di­­na­ry
­­re­­quest, but has it been at­­ten­­de­d ­­to?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I put it the­­re my­­sel­­f, ­­sir.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Who ­­wait?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Jo­­nes, Ed­munds, Bro­oks, an­d ­Tom­kins.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Ve­ry good. Then I think that will do. Stay! You had bet­­ter tell the
­­hall por­­ter to look out for three gen­t­­le­­men pre­­sen­­ting plain vi­­si­­ting­­
cards with a litt­­le red spot on them. Let Bro­oks wait in the hall, an­d
when they ar­ri­ve tell him to show them straight up to the ro­om.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>It shall be do­­ne, ­­sir.”</p> 
 <p>The head wai­ter left the ro­om, and the ma­na­ger stret­ched him­self in his
chair, yaw­ned by way of sho­wing his im­por­tan­ce, and then sa­id so­lemn­ly,—</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I don’t be­­li­e­ve they’ll any of them turn up; but if they do, this Dr.
­­Ni­ko­la, who­e­ver he may be, won’t be ab­­le to find fault with my ar­ran­ge­­ments.”</p> 
 <p>Then, le­a­ving the du­sty high ro­ad of Bu­si­nes­s, he and his com­pa­ni­on
­wan­de­red in the sh­a­dy brid­le-­paths of Lo­ve—­to the end that when the
chi­ef book­kee­per re­tur­ned to her own de­part­ment she had for­got­ten the
stran­ge din­ner par­ty about to ta­ke pla­ce upsta­irs, and was bu­si­ly
en­ga­ged upon a cal­cu­la­tion as to how she would look in white sa­tin an­d
o­ran­ge blos­soms, an­d, that sett­led, fell to won­de­ring whet­her it was
tru­e, as Miss Joyce, a sub­or­di­na­te, had been heard to decla­re, that the
­ma­na­ger had on­ce shown him­self par­ti­al to a cer­tain wi­dow with re­pu­ted
s­avings and a sha­re in an ex­ten­si­ve egg and dairy ­bu­si­ness.</p> 
 <p>At ten mi­nu­tes to eight pre­ci­se­ly a han­som drew up at the steps of the
­ho­tel. As soon as it stop­ped, an un­der­si­zed gent­le­man, with a cle­an
s­ha­ven coun­ten­an­ce, a ca­no­ni­cal cor­po­ra­tion, and bow legs, dres­sed in a
­de­ci­ded­ly cle­ri­cal gar­b, alight­ed. He paid and di­schar­ged his cab­man,
and then took from his tick­et pock­et an or­di­na­ry white vi­si­ting card,
which he pre­sen­ted to the gold-la­ced in­di­vi­du­al who had ope­ned the
a­pron. The lat­ter, ha­ving no­ted the red spot, cal­led a wai­ter, and the
­re­ve­rend gent­le­man was im­me­di­a­te­ly escor­ted up­sta­irs.</p> 
 <p>Hard­ly had the at­t­en­dant ti­me to re­turn to his sta­tion in the hall,
­be­fo­re a se­cond cab ma­de its ap­pearan­ce, clo­se­ly fol­lo­wed by a third.
Out of the se­cond jum­ped a tall, ac­ti­ve, well-­built man of about thir­ty
y­e­ars of age. He was dres­sed in eve­ning dress of the la­test fa­shion, an­d
­to conce­al it from the vul­gar ga­ze, wo­re a lar­ge In­ver­ness ca­pe of heavy
­tex­tu­re. He al­so in his turn han­ded a white card to the por­ter, an­d,
­ha­ving do­ne so, pro­ceeded in­to the hall, fol­lo­wed by the oc­cu­pant of the
last ca­b, who had clo­se­ly co­pi­ed his ex­amp­le. This in­di­vi­du­al was al­so
in eve­ning dres­s, but it was of a dif­fe­rent stamp. It was old-­fa­shio­ned­
and had seen much use. The wea­rer, too, was tal­ler than the or­di­na­ry run
of men, while it was no­ti­ce­a­b­le that his hair was snow-white, and that
­his fa­ce was dee­ply pit­ted with smallpox. Af­ter dis­po­sing of their hats
and coats in an an­te-ro­om, they reached ro­om No. 22, whe­re they foun­d
the gent­le­man in cle­ri­cal cos­tu­me pa­cing im­pa­ti­ent­ly up an­d ­down.</p> 
 <p>Left alo­ne, the tal­lest of the tri­o, who for want of a bet­ter tit­le we
­may call the Best Dres­sed Man, took out his wat­ch, and ha­ving glan­ced at
it, looked at his com­pa­ni­ons. “Gent­le­men,” he sa­id, with a slight
A­me­ri­can ac­cen­t, “it is three mi­nu­tes to eight o’clock. My na­me is E­as­to­ver!”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I’m glad to hear it, for I’m most un­com­­mon­ly hung­­ry,” sa­id the nex­­t
­­tal­­lest, whom I ha­ve al­­re­a­­dy descri­­bed as be­ing so marked by di­­se­a­­se.
“My na­­me is P­­ren­­der­gast!”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>We on­ly wait for our fri­end and host,” re­­marked the cle­ri­cal gen­t­­le­­man,
as if he felt he ought to ta­­ke a sha­­re in the con­ver­­sa­­tion, and then, as
an af­­tert­­hought, he con­­ti­nu­ed, “My na­­me is ­­Bax­­­ter!”</p> 
 <p>They shook hands all round with marked cor­di­a­li­ty, se­a­ted them­sel­ves
a­gain, and took it in turns to ex­a­mi­ne the clock.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Ha­ve you ever had the ple­a­su­­re of me­e­­ting our host be­­fo­­re?” asked Mr.
­­Bax­­­ter of Mr. P­­ren­­der­gast.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Ne­ver,” re­p­li­ed that gen­t­­le­­man, with a sha­­ke of his head. “Per­­haps Mr.
E­as­­to­ver has been mo­­re ­­for­­tu­­na­­te?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Not I,” was the bri­ef re­jo­in­­der. “I’ve had to do with him off and on
­­for long­­er than I ca­­re to reck­­on, but I’ve ne­ver set ey­es on him up to ­­da­­te.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>And whe­­re may he ha­ve been the first ti­­me you heard from ­­him?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>In Nas­­h­­vil­­le, Ten­­nes­­se­e,” sa­id Eas­­to­ver. “A­f­­ter that, Ta­hu­­pa­­pa, New
Ze­a­lan­d; af­­ter that, Pa­pe­e­­te, in the So­­ci­e­ty Is­lands; then Pe­kin, Chi­­na.
An­d y­ou?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>First ti­­me, Brus­­sels; se­con­d, Mon­­te Vi­­de­o; third, Man­­da­lay, and then
the Gold Coast, Af­ri­ca. It’s your tur­n, Mr. ­­Bax­­­ter.”</p> 
 <p>The cler­gy­man glan­ced at the ti­mepie­ce. It was ex­act­ly eight o’clock­.
“­First ti­me, Ca­bul, Af­gha­ni­stan; se­con­d, Nij­ni Nov­gorod, Rus­si­a; third,
Wil­can­ni­a, Dar­ling Ri­ver, Au­stra­li­a; fourt­h, Val­pa­ra­iso, Chi­li; fift­h,
­Na­ga­sa­ki, ­Ja­pan.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>He is evi­­den­t­ly a gre­at tra­­vel­­ler and a most mys­­te­ri­ous per­­son.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>He is mo­­re than that,” sa­id Eas­­to­ver with con­­vic­­tion; “he is la­­te for ­­din­­ner!”</p> 
 <p>Pren­der­gast looked at his ­watch.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>That clock is two mi­nu­­tes fast. Har­k, the­­re go­es Big Ben! Eight ex­­act­ly.”</p> 
 <p>As he spo­ke the do­or was thrown open and a vo­ice an­noun­ced “Dr. ­Ni­ko­la.”</p> 
 <p>The three men sprang to their fe­et si­mul­ta­ne­ous­ly, with ex­cla­ma­tions of
as­to­nish­men­t, as the man they had been di­scus­sing ma­de his ap­pearan­ce.</p> 
 <p>It would ta­ke mo­re ti­me than I can spa­re the sub­ject to gi­ve you an
a­de­qua­te and in­clu­si­ve descrip­tion of the per­son who en­te­red the ro­om at
t­hat mo­ment. In sta­tu­re he was slight­ly abo­ve the or­di­na­ry, his
s­houl­ders were bro­ad, his limbs per­fect­ly sha­ped and plain­ly muscu­lar,
­but ve­ry slim. His head, which was mag­ni­fi­cent­ly set upon his shoul­ders,
­was ador­ned with a pro­fu­sion of glos­sy black hair; his fa­ce was
­de­sti­tu­te of beard or mou­sta­che, and was of oval sha­pe and handso­me
­moulding; while his skin was of a dark oli­ve hu­e, a co­lour which
­har­mo­ni­zed well with his pi­er­cing black ey­es and pear­ly te­eth. His hands
and fe­et were small, and the gre­a­test dan­dy must ha­ve ad­mit­ted that he
­was ir­re­proacha­bly dres­sed, with a ne­at­ness that bor­de­red on the
­pu­ri­ta­ni­cal. In age he might ha­ve been anyt­hing from eight-an­d-­twen­ty to
­for­ty; in re­a­li­ty he was thir­ty-three. He ad­van­ced in­to the ro­om an­d
­walked with out-st­ret­ched hand di­rect­ly across to whe­re Eas­to­ver was
s­tan­ding by the ­fi­re­pla­ce.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Mr. Eas­­to­ver, I fe­el cer­­tain,” he sa­id, fix­­ing his glit­­te­ring ey­es upon
the man he add­­res­­sed, and al­lo­wing a cu­ri­ous smi­­le to play upon his ­­fa­­ce.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>That is my na­­me, Dr. Ni­ko­la,” the ot­­her an­swered with evi­­dent sur­pri­­se.
“­­But how on earth can you dis­­tin­­gu­ish me from your ot­­her ­­gu­ests?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Ah! it would sur­pri­­se you if you knew. And Mr. Pren­­der­gast, and Mr.
­­Bax­­­ter. This is de­­light­­ful; I ho­pe I am not la­­te. We had a col­­li­­sion in­­
the Chan­­nel this mor­­ning, and I was al­­most af­­raid I might not be up to
­­ti­­me. Din­­ner se­ems re­a­­dy; shall we sit down to it?” They se­a­­ted
t­­hem­­sel­ves, and the me­al com­­menced. The Im­pe­ri­al Re­­stau­rant has ear­­ned­­
an en­­vi­a­b­­le re­­pu­­ta­­tion for do­ing things well, and the din­­ner that night
­­did not in any way detract from its lust­­re. But, de­­light­­ful as it all
­­was, it was no­­ti­­ce­a­­b­­le that the three gu­ests paid mo­­re at­­ten­­tion to
t­­heir host than to his ex­­­cel­­lent   <em>me­nu</em>. As they had sa­id be­fo­re his
ar­ri­val, they had all had de­a­lings with him for se­ve­ral ye­ars, but what
t­ho­se de­a­lings were they were ca­re­ful not to descri­be. It was mo­re than
­pos­sib­le that they hard­ly liked to re­mem­ber them t­hem­sel­ves.</p> 
 <p>When cof­fee had been ser­ved and the ser­vants had with­drawn, Dr. Ni­ko­la
ro­se from the ta­ble, and went across to the mas­si­ve si­de­board. On it
s­tood a bas­ket of ve­ry cu­ri­ous sha­pe and work­mans­hip. This he ope­ned­,
and as he did so, to the asto­nish­ment of his gu­ests, an enor­mous cat, as
­black as his mas­ter’s coat, le­a­ped out on to the flo­or. The re­a­son for
the sau­cer and jug of milk beca­me e­vi­dent.</p> 
 <p>Se­a­ting him­self at the ta­ble again, the host fol­lo­wed the ex­amp­le of his
­gu­ests and lit a ci­gar, blo­wing a cloud of smo­ke lux­u­ri­ous­ly through his
­de­li­ca­te­ly chi­sel­led nostrils. His ey­es wan­de­red round the cor­nice of
the ro­om, took in the pic­tu­res and de­co­ra­tions, and then ca­me down to
­me­et the fa­ces of his com­pa­ni­ons. As they did so, the black cat, ha­ving­
­fi­nis­hed its me­al, sprang on to his shoul­der to crouch the­re, wat­ching­
the three men through the cur­ling smo­ke drift with its green blin­king­,
­fi­en­dish ey­es. Dr. Ni­ko­la smi­led as he no­ti­ced the ef­fect the ani­mal had
u­pon his ­gu­ests.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Now shall we get to bu­­si­­nes­s?” he sa­id ­­briskly.</p> 
 <p>The ot­hers al­most si­mul­ta­ne­ous­ly knock­ed the as­hes off their ci­gars an­d
­brought them­sel­ves to at­ten­tion. Dr. Ni­ko­la’s dain­ty, lan­guid man­ner
­se­emed to drop from him li­ke a clo­ak, his ey­es brigh­te­ned, and his
­vo­i­ce, when he spo­ke, was cle­an cut as chi­sel­led ­sil­ver.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>You are doubtless anx­­ious to be in­­­for­­med why I sum­­mo­­ned you from all
­­parts of the glo­­be to me­et me he­­re to-­­night? And it is ve­ry na­­tu­ral you
s­­hould be. But then, from what you know of me, you should not be
­­sur­pri­­sed at anyt­­hing I ­­do.”</p> 
 <p>His vo­ice drop­ped back in­to its old to­ne of gent­le lan­g­uor. He drew in a
gre­at bre­ath of smo­ke and then sent it slow­ly out from his lips again.
­His ey­es were half clo­sed, and he drum­med with one fing­er on the ta­ble
ed­ge. The cat looked through the smo­ke at the three men, and it se­emed
­to them that he grew eve­ry mo­ment lar­ger and mo­re fe­ro­cious. Pre­sent­ly
­his ow­ner took him from his per­ch, and se­a­ting him on his knee fell to
stro­king his fur, from head to tail, with his long slim fing­ers. It was
as if he were drawing in­spi­ra­tion for so­me dead­ly mi­schi­ef from the
un­can­ny ­be­ast.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>To pre­­fa­­ce what I ha­ve to say to you, let me tell you that this is by
­­far the most im­­por­­tant bu­­si­­ness for which I ha­ve ever re­­qui­­red your
­­help. (Three slow stro­­kes down the cen­t­­re of the back, and one roun­d
each ear.) When it first ca­­me in­­­to my mind I was at a loss who to trust
in the mat­­ter. I thought of Ven­­don, but I found Ven­­don was de­ad. I
t­­hought of Brown­low, but Brown­low was no long­­er fait­h­­ful. (Two stro­­kes
­­down the back and two on the thro­at.) Then bit by bit I re­­mem­­be­­red you.
I was in Bra­­zil at the ti­­me. So I sent for you. You ca­­me. So far so ­­good.”</p> 
 <p>He ro­se, and cros­sed over to the fi­re­pla­ce. As he went the cat craw­led
­back to its ori­gi­nal po­si­tion on his shoul­der. Then his vo­ice chang­ed
on­ce mo­re to its for­mer bu­si­nes­s-­li­ke ­to­ne.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I am not go­ing to tell you ve­ry much about it. But from what I do tell
y­ou, you will be ab­­le to gat­­her a gre­at de­al and ima­­gi­­ne the rest. To
­­be­­gin wit­­h, the­­re is a man li­­ving in this world to-­­day who has do­­ne me a
g­re­at and las­­ting in­­ju­ry. What that in­­ju­ry is is no con­­cern of yours.
Y­ou would not un­­der­s­­tand if I told you. So we’ll le­a­ve that out of the
­­ques­­tion. He is im­­men­­se­ly rich. His che­­que for £300,000 would be
­­ho­­nou­­red by his bank at any mi­nu­­te. Ob­­vious­ly he is a power. He has had
­­re­a­­son to know that I am pit­­ting my wits against his, and he flat­­ters
­­him­­self that so far he has got the bet­­ter of me. That is becau­­se I am
drawing him on. I am ma­­tu­ring a plan which will ma­­ke him a po­or and a
ve­ry mi­­se­ra­b­­le man at one and the sa­­me ti­­me. If that sche­­me suc­­ceeds,
and I am sa­­tis­­fi­ed with the way you three men ha­ve per­­for­­med the parts I
s­­hall call on you to play in it, I shall pay to each of you the sum of
£10,000. If it do­esn’t suc­­ceed, then you will each re­­ce­i­ve a thou­­san­d
and your ex­­pen­­ses. Do you fol­low ­­me?”</p> 
 <p>It was evi­dent from their fa­ces that they hung upon his eve­ry word.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>But, re­­mem­­ber, I de­­mand from you your who­­le and en­­ti­­re la­­bour. While
y­ou are ser­­ving me you are mi­­ne bo­­dy and soul. I know you are
trus­­twort­­hy. I ha­ve had good pro­of that you are—­­par­­don the
ex­­p­res­­sion—unscru­­pu­lous, and I flat­­ter my­­self you are si­­lent. What is
­­mo­­re, I shall tell you not­­hing beyond what is ne­­ces­­sa­ry for the car­ry­ing­­
out of my sche­­me, so that you could not be­tray me if you would. Now for
my plans!”</p> 
 <p>He sat down again and took a pa­per from his pock­et. Ha­ving pe­ru­sed it,
he tur­ned to E­as­to­ver.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>You will le­a­ve at on­­ce—t­­hat is to say, by the bo­at on Wed­­nes­­day—­­for
­­Syd­­­ney. You will book your pas­­sa­ge to-­­mor­row mor­­ning, first thing, an­d
jo­in her in Ply­­mouth. You will me­et me to-­­mor­row eve­­ning at an add­­ress I
will send you, and re­­ce­i­ve your fi­­nal in­­­struc­­tions­­. ­­Good-­­night.”</p> 
 <p>Seeing that he was ex­pected to go, Eas­to­ver ro­se, shook hands, and left
the ro­om wit­hout a word. He was too asto­nis­hed to he­si­ta­te or to say anyt­hing.</p> 
 <p>Ni­ko­la took anot­her let­ter from his pock­et and tur­ned to Pren­der­gast.
“<em>You</em>  will go down to Do­ver to-­night, cross to Pa­ris to-­mor­row mor­ning­,
and le­a­ve this let­ter per­so­nal­ly at the add­ress you will find writ­ten on
it. On Thurs­day, at hal­f-­past two pre­ci­se­ly, you will de­li­ver me an
answer in the porch at Cha­ring Cross. You will find suf­fi­ci­ent mo­ney in­
t­hat en­ve­lope to pay all your ex­pen­ses. Now ­go!”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>At hal­­f-­­past two you shall ha­ve your an­swer. ­­Good-­­night.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Good-­­night.”</p> 
 <p>When Pren­der­gast had left the ro­om, Dr. Ni­ko­la lit anot­her ci­gar an­d
­tur­ned his at­ten­tions to Mr. ­Bax­ter.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Six months ag­­o, Mr. Bax­­­ter, I found for you a si­­tu­a­­tion as tu­­tor to the
y­oung Mar­­quis of Beck­­en­­ham. You still hold it, I sup­­po­­se?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I ­­do.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Is the fat­­her well dis­­po­­sed to­­wards y­ou?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>In eve­ry way. I ha­ve do­­ne my best to in­­gra­­ti­a­­te my­­self with him. That
­­was one of your ­in­­struc­­tions­­.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Yes, yes! But I was not cer­­tain that you would suc­­ceed. If the old man
is anyt­­hing li­­ke what he was when I last met him he must still be a
­­di­f­­fi­cult per­­son to de­al with. Do­es the boy li­­ke y­ou?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I ho­pe ­­so.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Ha­ve you brought me his pho­­to­graph as I ­­di­­rected?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I ha­ve. He­­re it is.”</p> 
 <p>Bax­ter took a pho­to­graph from his pock­et and han­ded it across the ­tab­le.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Good. You ha­ve do­­ne ve­ry well, Mr. Bax­­­ter. I am ple­a­­sed with you.
­­To-­­mor­row mor­­ning you will go back to Y­or­k­s­hi­­re——”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I beg your par­­don, Bour­­ne­­mouth. His Gra­­ce owns a house ne­ar
­­Bour­­ne­­mout­­h, which he oc­cu­pi­es du­ring the sum­­mer ­­months.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Ve­ry well—t­­hen to-­­mor­row mor­­ning you will go back to Bour­­ne­­mouth an­d
con­­ti­nue to in­­gra­­ti­a­­te your­­self with fat­­her and son. You will al­­so be­­gin
­­to im­plant in the boy’s mind a de­­si­­re for tra­­vel. Don’t let him be­come
a­­wa­­re that his de­­si­­re has its sour­­ce in you—­­but do not fail to fos­­ter
it all you can. I will com­mu­­ni­ca­­te with you furt­­her in a day or two. Now ­­go.”</p> 
 <p>Bax­ter in his turn left the ro­om. The do­or clo­sed. Dr. Ni­ko­la pick­ed up
the pho­to­graph and stu­di­ed it.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>The li­­ke­­ness is un­­mis­­ta­ka­b­­le—or it ought to be. My fri­en­d, my ve­ry
­­de­ar fri­en­d, Wet­­he­­rell, my toils are clo­­sing on you. My ar­ran­ge­­ments are
per­­fecting them­­sel­ves ad­­mi­rably. Pre­­sen­t­ly, when all is com­p­le­­te, I
s­­hall press the le­ver, the machi­­ne­ry will be set in mo­­tion, and you will
­­find your­­self be­ing slow­ly but su­­re­ly ground in­­­to pow­­der. Then you will
­­hand over what I wan­t, and be sor­ry you thought fit to baulk Dr. ­­Ni­ko­la!”</p> 
 <p>He rang the bell and or­de­red his bill. This du­ty di­schar­ged, he pla­ced
the cat back in its pri­son, shut the lid, des­cen­ded with the bas­ket to
the hall, and cal­led a han­som. The por­ter in­qui­red to what add­ress he
s­hould or­der the cab­man to dri­ve. Dr. Ni­ko­la did not re­ply for a mo­men­t,
t­hen he sa­id, as if he had been thin­king so­met­hing out: “The  <em>Gre­en
­Sa­i­lor</em>  pu­blic-­house, East In­dia Dock­ Ro­ad.”</p>
